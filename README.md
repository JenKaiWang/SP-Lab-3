# SP-Lab-3

This program will reads data from a file and computes some basic statistical analysis measures for the data.

Num value : computes how many values inside

mean : Calculates the average of all values in the dataset.

median : Determines the middle point in the dataset.

stddev : Measures the deviation of data points from the mean.

mode : Identifies the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

Geometric mean : Suitable for positive number sets, it calculates the Nth root of the product of values.

Harmonic Mean : Particularly applicable for averaging rates, such as speed and density.

Unused array capacity : Indicates the amount of space in the dynamic array that is not being used.
